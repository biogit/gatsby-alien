## Where is the First Post?

As mentioned in the [First Post](../hello-world/), the internal debate
between calling it as such or "Hello World" was resolved in favor of the latter.

### Second Implies First

conventions for starting blogs, this is the *Second Post*.

### A Better Greeting for Aliens?

Given the uncertainty about the appropriate [number](../hello-world/) of fingers,
perhaps the *Second Post* can inspire a better universal greeting?
