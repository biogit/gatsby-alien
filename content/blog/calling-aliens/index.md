## From SETI to CSETI

The **search for extraterrestrial intelligence** ([SETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence))
using modern technology and scientific methodology has started in 1960s. These efforts primarily involve
trying to detect signals or signatures of alien civilizations via astronomical observations in
radio, optical, infrared, or x-ray bands of electromagnetic spectrum.

Since 1990s, an organization with a similar, yet distinct, acronym--the Center for the Study of
Extraterrestrial Intelligence
([CSETI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_the_Study_of_Extraterrestrial_Intelligence))--has been
created to promote *human-initiated* contacts with UFOs (and possibly with their extraterrestrial alien occupants)
closer to home.

### Lights to the Sky

One of the *CSETI* activities in the *Ambassador to the Universe* program are
[expeditions](https://siriusdisclosure.com/expeditions/expeditions-w-dr-greer/) during which
the participants try to communicate to nearby UFOs via *CE-5 Contact Protocols*.
