## Brief History of Flying Saucers

The term [flying saucer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_saucer) is much more recent than
historical observations and depictions of disc-shaped flying objects, which go back at least
to the medieval times.

In the modern US press, the term appeared in 1930s, but became commonly used after the famous
[sighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Arnold_UFO_sighting) by Kenneth Arnold in 1947.

### What Did Arnold See?

For the generally controversial subject, it is not surprising that the connection of the *flying saucer*
term to what Arnold actually said is also controversial. This includes his own recollections, but the
general agreement is that he did mention something related to "saucers" at the time.

## Flying Saucer Sighting?

Skeptics, of course, posit that many sightings of flying saucers from a distance can be explained
by a combination of natural phenomena and lighting conditions, which can make a simple cloud look
like a convincing flying saucer.
