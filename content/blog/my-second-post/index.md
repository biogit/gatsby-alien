description: "Because the First Post was called 'Hello World'."

As I mentioned in the [First Post](../hello-world/), the internal debate
between calling it as such or "Hello World" was resolved in favor of the latter.

So there was no *First Post*, but to keep with both of the traditional
conventions for starting blogs, this is the *Second Post*.
