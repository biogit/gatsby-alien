## Aliens and UFO Ridicule

The **UFO** terminology has been originally [created](../saucer-to-ufo/) as a more serious
way to describe *flying saucers*. Over the following 50 years, however, the new terminology
suffered the same fate and became often used by the genral public and the media to ridicule
the investigation of or even the belief in the extraterrestrial origin of the UFOs.

## Serious People Choose UAP

New terminology to the rescue: unidentified aerial phenomena
([UAP](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/ufos-uaps-and-craps/)). The exact terminology
has not been settled yet, so **UAP** can be interpreted also as the more
general "unidentified anomalous phenomena". But this is now the preferred terminology when
serious people, from non-ironic government [programs](https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/16/pentagon-ufo-search-harry-reid-216111),
get involved. After all, someone has to keep the Earth secure from alien invasions.
