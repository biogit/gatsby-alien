## Why Hello World?

*Hello World* title for the first blog post is not only traditional, but also appropriate for the subject of the
*Alien Cafe* blog. After all, greetings are one of the most popular cultural tropes related to aliens.

### Greetings Humans!

The greeting below is rather spooky by intention. As the famous quote from the
[Alien movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(film)) goes:

> There are things so terrifying, they only exist in a nightmare ... or outer space.

#### How Many Fingers?

Unfortunately, the authoritative [grey alien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_alien) entry on Wikipedia
does not specify the **correct** number of fingers for any of the species mentioned therein. So human-like
five fingers may be as good guess as any, even though in popular culture handprints are believed to need
four or six fingers to be considered as strong evidence of being alien in nature.
