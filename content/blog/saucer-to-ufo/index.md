## Unidentified Flying Objects

In 1950s, the United States Air Force has introduced to the public a new term to replace *flying saucers*:
unidentified flying objects (UFOs). This terminology is more general, as it does not explicitly require a
particular shape of the object in question. Technically, does not imply that the object is alien either.

### Lights in the Sky

Once the concept of UFOs entered the popular culture, it opened the floodgates for the "lights in the sky"
sightings, which are obviously a lot more common than sightings of objects identifiable as flying saucers.

#### Alien Physics

The signature expected by observers from lights in the sky that are real alien UFOs is the impossible physics.
Which means, for example, speed or acceleration incompatible with terrestrial technology and/or survival of human occupants.
These may be difficult to establish from observations without speed and distance references, but trajectories
with impossibly sharp turns or "teleportation" jumps should be evident in photos or videos.
